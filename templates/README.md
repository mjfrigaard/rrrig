# R Templates

This is a collection of templates for R scripts, .Rmd files, etc.

If you want to use the `new-project-folders.Rmd` file, enter the following into the console (after creating a new RStudio project).


```r
download.file(url = "http://bit.ly/Rmd-proj-template", destfile = "README.Rmd")
```
